# prisoner-managment
My first web project features a dual-interface system (admin/client) built with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL.  Client Side: Public portal to search prisoner details via ID card.  Admin Side: Secure dashboard to manage prisoner data, meetings, and status updates.  Backend: PHP handles CRUD operations; MySQL ensures data integrity with encrypted logins.
